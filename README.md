just another repository

My name is Iceyine, I like reading books, but in recent years, I'm addicted to play computer games.
I be sure know that is a bad habbit, so from now, I will make me a change.
the following things is what I make for myself:
1. reading english books once a week;
2. learning jenkins everyday;
3. using Git to practice;

that all
wish a good day come soon
